I am currently a tenure track assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

Before joining HKUST, I was a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University under the supervison of Dr. [Daniel Appel&ouml;](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo) and Dr. [Yingda Cheng](https://yingdacheng.github.io/). I got my doctoral degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Instittute (RPI) under the supervision of Dr. [Fengyan Li](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~lif/).
