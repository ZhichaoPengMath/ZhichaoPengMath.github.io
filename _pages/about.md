I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

Before joining HKUST, I was a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel Appel&ouml;](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo) and Dr. [Yingda Cheng](https://yingdacheng.github.io/). I got my doctoral degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) under the supervision of Dr. [Fengyan Li](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~lif/).

Research Interest 
======
From a methodology perspective, my current research interests include (1) design, analysis and implementation of numerical solvers for PDEs and (2) model order reduction to reduce computational cost. 

From a problem perspective, I am more interested in kinetic equations and wave equations these days.

- Computational methods for kinetic problems, wave equations, electromagnetics and other problems.

	- Development of finite element method, finite difference method, embedded boundary method
	- Structure preserving methods: asymptotic preserving method, positivity preserving method, energy stable method
	- Fast solvers and preconditioners for time-harmonic Maxwell's equation and Helmholtz equation 

- Data driven and projection based reduced order models for kinetic equations, hyperbolic equations and other transport dominant problems

During my postdoc period, I also did research in characterization and control problems for quantum computing. Believe it or not, I have performed physics experiments on real quantum devices.
