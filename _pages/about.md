I am currently a tenure track assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

Before joining HKUST, I was a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University under the supervison of Dr. [Daniel Appel&ouml;](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo) and Dr. [Yingda Cheng](https://yingdacheng.github.io/). I got my doctoral degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Instittute (RPI) under the supervision of Dr. [Fengyan Li](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~lif/).

Research Interest 
======
From the methodlogy perspective, my current research interests include (1) design, analysis and implementation of numerical solvers for PDEs and (2) model order reduction techniques to reduce computational cost. 

From the problem perspective, I am interested in kinetic equations and wave equations.

- Computational methods for kinetic problems, wave equations, electromagnetics and other problems.

	- Development of finite element method, finite difference method, embedded boundary method
	- Structure preserving methods: asymptotic preserving method, positivity preserving method, energy stable method
	- Fast solvers and preconditioners for time-harmonic Maxwell's equation and Helmholtz equation 

- Reduced order models for kinetic equations, hyperbolic equations and other transport dominant problems

During my postdoc period, I also did research in characterization and control prolbems for quatum computing. Believe it or not, I have performed physics experiments on real quantum devices.
