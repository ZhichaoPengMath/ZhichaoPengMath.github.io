## Demo Code and a short tutorial for the EM-WaveHoltz method

### Demo code for a simple 1D problem
The Demo code is written to showcase how to couple EM-WaveHoltz with a time-domain solver:
[julia version](https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/files/WaveHoltz_1D_Demo.zip) [matlab version](https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/files/WaveHoltz_yang.m) 

The matlab demo code is written by me and [Dr. Pengliang Yang](https://yangpl.wordpress.com/). Great thanks to Pengliang for his great suggestions.

If you read our sample code, you may notice that we only fiter the electric field. The reason is that we are considering a simple problem with $Im(H)=0$. For more complicated problems, we need to filter both electric and magnetic fields.

### Basic ideas
1. Given the frequency-domain problem, such as the following simple non-dimensionalized case:
$$
\begin{align}
&i\omega E = \nabla\times H-J,\\
&i\omega H = -\nabla\times E.
\end{align}
$$
We define a time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
&\partial_t \tilde{E} =  \nabla\times \tilde{H}- \sin(\omega t)Re(J)-\cos(\omega t) Im(J),\\
&\partial_t \tilde{H} = -\nabla\times \tilde{E}ï¼Œ
\end{align}
$$
and a filtering operator acting on the initial condition of the time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}_0\\
	    \tilde{H}_0
	     \end{matrix}\right)
=\frac{2}{T}\int^{T}_{0}\left(\cos(\omega t)-\frac{1}{4}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}(t)\\
	    \tilde{H}(t)
	\end{matrix}\right)
	dt,\quad T=\frac{2\Pi}{\omega}.
\end{align}
$$
$\Pi\nu$ essentially filters the time-domain solution determined by the initial condition $\nu$ over one period.

1. With some simple [algebra]((https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/appendix/waveholtz/waveholtz_algebra.pdf), one can show that
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right)=
\left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right).
\end{align}
$$

Hence, solving the frequency-domain problem is equivalent to solve the fixed point problem 
$ \Pi\nu = \nu$ in the time-domain. 

To solve this time-domain fixed point problem, we have 
two choices.
- Apply fixed point iteration/Anderson acceleration. 
- Rewrite the $\Pi\nu = \nu$ as an equivalent linear system 
$$ (I-S)\nu = \Pi 0,\;\text{with}\;S\nu = \Pi \nu -\Pi 0,$$
and solve it with an iterative solver.

Remakr: Matrix vector multiplication $(I-S)\nu$ can be computed in a matrix-free manner based on a time-domain solver.
We also  want to point that $\Pi 0$ filters the solution corresponding to $0$ initial condition over one period and with non-zero source $\Pi 0\neq 0$.

### How to adapt your time-domain code to solve a frequency-domain problem?
Eessential new components include:
1. An integration in time to compute the result of the filtering operator, 
1. A function to wrap matrix-vector multiplication in matrix free format.

The filtering operator $\Pi$ can be implemented by adding a few more lines (red line) to your time-domain solver.

Based on the code for filtering opertor, the right hand side vector $\Pi 0$ and the  matrix-vector multiplication $(I-S)\nu$ can be computed in a matrix free manner.

At the end of the day, we can solve $(I-S)\nu = \Pi 0$ with a Krlov subspace iterative solver.

### Basic properties
1. To some extent, WaveHoltz can be seen as preconditioning the frequency-domain problem with time-domain simulations and filtering.

1. In comparsion with limiting amplitude principle, the filtering process makes the convergence faster. Also, the WaveHoltz method can be applied to problems in closed domain (e.g. PEC boundary conditions in all boundary). 

1. The number of iterations for convergence with a Krylov solver:
- Does not depend on points per wavelength. 
- With a fixed number of points per wave length, it scales as $(\omega)$ for open domain problems and $O(\omega^d)$ ($d$ is the dimension$ for the worst case prolbem.

1. For the energy conserving problem with PEC boundary conditions, real current $J$, real permitivity and real permeability, the resulting linear system is symmetric positive definite (SPD) with a proper discretization (such as Yee scheme). Note that for other cases, the resulting linear system may not be SPD. For example, in the case with non-reflecting boundary conditions such as PML or radiation boundary condition, the linear system will have complex eigenvalues. 

1. It is possible to compute solution corresponding to multiple frequency with one linear solve and post-processing. See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14789) for details.
