# WaveHoltz
======
Simple 1D demo codes to showcase how to couple EM-WaveHoltz with a time-domain solver [julia](https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/files/WaveHoltz_1D_Demo.zip)

### Basic Ideas: 
1. Given the frequency-domain problem, such as the following simple non-dimensionalized case:
$$
\begin{align}
&i\omega E = \nabla\times H-J,\\
&i\omega H = -\nabla\times E,
\end{align}
$$
define the corresponding time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
&\partial_t \tilde{E} =  \nabla\times \tilde{H}- \sin(\omega t)Re(J)-\cos(\omega t) Im(J),\\
&\partial_t \tilde{H} = -\nabla\times \tilde{E}ï¼Œ
\end{align}
$$
and a filtering operator acting on the initial condition of the time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}_0\\
	    \tilde{H}_0
	     \end{matrix}\right)
=\frac{2}{T}\int^{T}_{0}\left(\cos(\omega t)-\frac{1}{4}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}(t)\\
	    \tilde{H}(t)
	\end{matrix}\right)
	dt,\quad T=\frac{2\Pi}{\omega}.
\end{align}
$$
$\Pi\nu$ essentially filters the time-domain solution determined by the initial condition $\nu$ over one period.

1. With some simple [algebra]((https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/appendix/waveholtz/waveholtz_algebra.pdf), one can show that
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right)=
\left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right).
\end{align}
$$

Hence, solving the frequency-domain problem is equivalent to solve the fixed point problem 
$ \Pi\nu = \nu$ in the time-domain. 

To solve this time-domain fixed point problem, we have 
two choices.
- Apply fixed point iteration/Anderson acceleration. 
- Rewrite the $\Pi\nu = \nu$ as an equivalent linear system 
$$ (I-S)\nu = \Pi 0,\;\text{with}\;S\nu = \Pi \nu -\Pi 0,$$
and solve it with an iterative solver.

Matrix vector multiplication $(I-S)\nu$ can be computed in a matrix-free manner based on a time-domain solver.

We want to point that $\Pi 0$ filters the solution corresponding to $0$ initial condition over one period and with non-zero source $\Pi 0\neq 0$. 

1. To some extent, WaveHoltz can be seen as preconditioning the frequency-domain problem with time-domain simulations and filtering.

-In comparsion with limiting amplitude principle, the filtering process makes the convergence faster. Also, the WaveHoltz method can be applied to problems in closed domain (e.g. PEC boundary conditions in all boundary). 
- The number of iterations for convergence does not depend on the points per wavelength. 
- With a fixed number of points per wave length, it scales as $(\omega)$ for open domain problems and $O(\omega^d)$ ($d$ is the dimension$ for the worst case prolbem.
