WaveHoltz
======
Simple 1D demo codes to showcase how to couple EM-WaveHoltz with a time-domain solver[julia](https://zhichaopengmath.github.io/files/WaveHoltz_1D_Demo.zip)

Basic Ideas: 
1. Given the frequency-domain problem, such as the following simple non-dimensionalized case:
$$
\begin{align}
i\omega E = \nabla\times H-J,\\
i\omega H = -\nabla\times E,
\end{align}
$$
define the corresponding time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
\partial_t \tilde{E} =  \nabla\times \tilde{H}- \sin(\omega t)Re(J)-\cos(\omega t) Im(J),\\
\partial_t \tilde{H} = -\nabla\times \tilde{E}ï¼Œ
\end{align}
$$
and a filtering operator acting on the initial condition of the time-domain problem
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}_0\\
	    \tilde{H}_0
	     \end{matrix}\right)
=\frac{2}{T}\int^{T}_{0}\left(\cos(\omega t)-\frac{1}{4}\right)
\left(\begin{matrix}
	    \tilde{E}(t)\\
	    \tilde{H}(t)
	\end{matrix}\right)
	dt,\quad T=\frac{2\Pi}{\omega}.
\end{align}
$$
$\Pi\nu$ essentially filters the time-domain solution determined by the initial condition $\nu$ over one period.

1. With some simple algebra (check Appendix 1), one can show that
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right)=
\left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right).
\end{align}
$$

Hence, solving the frequency-domain problem is equivalent to solve the fixed point problem 
$ \Pi\nu = \nu$ in the time-domain. To solve this time-domain fixed point problem, we have 
two choices.
    1. One can apply fixed point iteration/Anderson acceleration. 
    1. One can rewrite the $\Pi\nu = \nu$ as an equivalent linear system 
    $$ (I-S)\nu = \Pi 0,$$
    where $$S\nu = \Pi \nu -\Pi 0.$$

    One can implement matrix-vector product $(I-S)\nu$ in a matrix-free manner based on a time-domain solver, and applies Krylov subspace iterative solver to solve $(I-S)\nu=\Pi 0$.

    We want to point that $\Pi 0$ filters the solution corresponding to $0$ initial condition over one period and with non-zero source $\Pi 0\neq 0$. 

1. In comparsion with limiting amplitude principle, the filtering process makes the convergence faster. Also, the WaveHoltz method can be applied to problems in closed domain (e.g. PEC boundary conditions in all boundary). 

$(I-S)\nu = \Pi 0$ is a better conditioned linear system. To some extent, the method can be seen as a preconditioner. The number of iterations for convergence does not depend on the points per wavelength. 
With a fixed number of points per wave length, it scales as $(\omega)$ for open domain problems and $O(\omega^d)$ ($d$ is the dimension$ for the worst case prolbem.

Appendix 1
======
Suppose $(E,H)^T$ is the solutions of the non-dimensionalized equation
$$
\begin{align}
i\omega E = \nabla\times H-J,\\
i\omega H = -\nabla\times E,
\end{align}
$$
We will obtain 
$$
\begin{align}
-\omega Im(E) = \nabla\times Re(H)-Re(J), \\
 \omega Re(E) = \nabla\times Im(H)-Im(J), \\
-\omega Im(H) = -\nabla\times Re(E), \\
\omega  Re(H) = -\nabla\times Im(E). 
\end{align}
$$
Utilizing this relation, one can verify that 
$$
\begin{align}
\tilde{E}(t) = Im(E) \cos(\omega t) + Re(E) \sin(\omega t), \\
\tilde{H}(t) = Im(H) \cos (\omega t) + Re(H) \sin (\omega t).
\end{align}
$$
is a solution of
$$
\begin{align}
\partial_t \tilde{E} =  \nabla\times \tilde{H}- \sin(\omega t)Re(J)-\cos(\omega t) Im(J),\\
\partial_t \tilde{H} = -\nabla\times \tilde{E}.
\end{align}
$$

Subsititute $( \tilde{E}_0,\tilde{H}_0)^T=(Im(E),Im(H))^T$ and $( \tilde{E}(t),\tilde{H}(t) )^T$into the definition of filtering operator $\Pi$, one can easily show that 
$$
\begin{align}
\Pi \left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right)=
\left(\begin{matrix}
Im(E)\\
Im(H)
\end{matrix}\right).
\end{align}
$$
