Linear kinetic transport equations under a diffusive scaling

Grad-Shafranov equation
--------------------------
The toroidally axisymmetric plasma equilibrium is determined by the Grad-Shafranov equation:
\\[\widetilde{\nabla}\left(\frac{1}{r}\widetilde{\nabla}\psi\right)=\mu_0 r^2\frac{\partial p}{\partial \psi}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial g^2}{\partial \psi},\\]
where \\(2\pi\psi(r,z)\\) is the poloidal magnetic flux, \\( p \\) is the plasma pressure, and 
\\(2\pig\\) is the net poloidal current flow and the toridal field coils. The magnetic field and the current, which are of more interest, are determined by \\(\widetilde{\nabla}\psi\\), hence, it is essential for a numerical solver to get an accurate approximation to \\(\widetilde{\nabla}\psi\\).
